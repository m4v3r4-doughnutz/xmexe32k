# xmexe32k
An tiny player for the XM tracker modules.

-- How to make an executable?
First click on the *!build.bat* batch file.
And it will convert the *music32k.asm* file to executable (*music32k.exe*).
You can change the *music32k.xm* file to your song but make sure you're made it with around 50 or 60 kB if samples aren't long.

-- I have an executable file with bigger size than 32kB! What must I do?
Click on the *!pack.bat* file or write this command:
*kkrunchy --out example_packed.exe music32k.exe*
You can also change the output file in the batch file so now you know how to do it :)

-- Where can I download this software? Just download it from this link: https://github.com/m4v3r4-doughnutz/xmexe32k
or download the *Git* program and write this: *git clone https://github.com/m4v3r4-doughnutz/xmexe32k.git*.
